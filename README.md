# Backing-Related-Crashes
This research aims to contribute to understanding the spatial and contextual dynamics of injury crashes, providing actionable insights for policymakers, engineers, and safety practitioners. The developed Shiny application helps users to identify crash locations, examine infrastructure deficiencies, and prioritize interventions. By enabling real-time visualization and interactive analysis, the tool offers a practical framework for data-driven decision-making in transportation safety. To maximize its utility and encourage further development, the tool's source code has been open-sourced and made available on GitHub . The GitHub repository includes documentation, example datasets, and usage instructions, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of users. 

In order to operate this application from the R environment, developers will need to create a MapBox Token.

A working demonstration of this application is available here: https://aitlab.shinyapps.io/BackingRelatedCrashes_V01/
